# Inspiration

During online school last year, it was especially hard for many students to stay productive and motivated as well as 
connect with peers. To this end, we developed an online platform, Study Ghibli, that would engage users in productive 
studying by facilitating a calm environment with relaxing music.

## What it does

Study Ghibli is a productivity platform which allows users to select Ghibli themed virtual environments to study with. 
A defining feature of our platform is that there is an option for users to study in the company of people online, 
in order to keep each other accountable for studying productively. In the virtual environment, Study Ghibli provides users 
with a countdown timer to track the time spent studying and also provides a space for users to add their 
goals and assignments they wish to achieve during the study period.


## Features

One notable achievement that we are proud of is our meticulous attention to detail. We tried our best to create an 
easily accessible and functional user interface while also decorating our prototype with vibrant themes. 
Since our coding skills were still intermediate, we focused our effort on graphic designing such as following a 
retro concept and creating smooth transitions.
