# Study Ghibli

Study Ghibli is a productivity platform which allows users to select Ghibli themed virtual environments to study with. A defining feature of our platform is that there is an option for users to study in the company of people online, in order to keep each other accountable for studying productively. In the virtual environment, Study Ghibli provides users with a countdown timer to track the time spent studying and also provides a space for users to add their goals and assignments they wish to achieve during the study period.

# Inspiration

During online school last year, it was especially hard for many students to stay productive and motivated as well as connect with peers. In an effort to resolve this cycle of procrastination, we identified an important element to staying productive: keeping one another accountable. To this end, we developed an online platform, Study Ghibli, that would engage users in productive studying by facilitating a calm environment with relaxing music in conjunction with online peers to keep each other accountable.
